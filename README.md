The navigation bar undergoes color changes as you navigate between pages, with options such as purple, yellow, pink, and more available for customization. Modifying these colors can be easily accomplished in the JavaScript file.
```js
const navigationOptions = [
    {
    name: 'home',
    color: '#5B37B7'
    },
    {
    name: 'likes',
    color: '#C9379D'
    },
    {
    name: 'search',
    color: '#E6A919'
    },
    {
    name: 'profile',
    color: '#1892A6'
    }
